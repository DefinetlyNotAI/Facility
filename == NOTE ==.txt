Test that TIME cutscene plays happy1 to 9 fullscreen with audio sfx/all/static.mp3 for the imgs durations, where img are 0.5s long and loop 3 times, thus 13.5s long audio plays as well

extra:
- add images, media etc. as needed (check sans fight images NECROPTOSIS - SP!Dusttale)
- add favicon.ico
- make some pages have custom titles on tab

ALSO CHECK TAS HINTS ARE NOT TOO EASY

NOTE: Make sure all audio is IN AUDIO TAGS in jsx, and never pure tsx code
NOTE: The YouTube vid is private, do unprivate when releasing
