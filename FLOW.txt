URL[/]<root> -> FOR ALL If not cookie[accepted] then redirect here else if here then redirect URL[Home]
  Asks for required site permissions,
  Shows trigger warnings, and requires to accept (once done, cookie[accepted] is made)
  Before redirecting, shows a warn message saying the console of the site shouldn't be used unless explicitly stated, as using it may ruin/break the puzzle for all

URL[Home] -> FOR HERE If cookie[Corrupt] then redirect to URL[h0m3]
  Random countdown once done a random voice cries "No matter, Time doesn't exist here"
  Bunch of lab looking text and special facility looking things
  Hovering over a specific line of text shows a bin string, to base64 that gives KEYWORD[1]
  A random place has a HEX code, which provides a TIME, if user changes their system time to that and refresh the HEX becomes a URL to redirect to URL[Wifi Panel], ofc once done create cookie[Wifi Unlocked] as well as hint to use curl/wget there
  If KONAMI code is used and cookie[Files unlocked] then create a popup saying user messed up, and create cookie[Corrupt] and refresh
  If cookie[No Corrupt] then show a popup that says to go to URL[Scroll] and create cookie[Scroll unlocked]

URL[Wifi Panel] -> FOR HERE If no cookie[wifi passed] but cookie[Wifi Unlocked] create cookie[wifi login] and redirect to URL[Wifi login], FOR HERE If not cookie[Wifi Unlocked] then 404
  2 buttons -> [Receive] and [Send]
  - Receive outputs a encoded message, which the algorithm would be in the html comments to help decipher, the message is a question that must be answered via the send
  - Send is locked until user inputs KEYWORD[1] as the password, then the button unlocks, if pressed a popup asks for the answer to the question, if answered correctly simulate sending the answer but then simulate a error and ask the user to use ceaser cipher to answer, if correct and all simulate everything loading well, and finally show URL[Media] and create cookie[Media Unlocked]
  If curl/wget is used, the json should return KEYWORD[2]

URL[Wifi Login] -> FOR HERE If not cookie[Wifi Unlocked] then 404, FOR HERE If cookie[wifi passed] redirect to URL[Wifi Panel]
  * IF FIRST TIME -> CUTSCENE[Interference]
  Generic login page, asks for username and password: 
  - Pass is written in the JS code and is able to be seen by the people in inspect, the hash should be easy to crack
  - Username is in a html comment that says to go to a youtube vid to remember the username, the vid is just a basic reversed audio saying the username (itgrowshere)
  When logged in create cookie[Wifi passed]

URL[Media] -> FOR HERE If not cookie[Media Unlocked] then 404
  Will ask for KEYWORD[2] to access the page,
  Will have 1 audio in site and 2 download buttons:
  - Audio: Has morse code that gives KEYWORD[3]
  - Download1: ZIP file that is pass protected with KEYWORD[3], has a txt file with invis ascii which is keyword[4]
  - Download2: Another ZIP file that is pass protected with KEYWORD[4], has a audio file with reversed audio that says to "Use your eyes for what you hear" where a QR is embedded in the audio that gives URL[Buttons]
  If all 3 items were interacted with, then create cookie[Button Unlocked]

URL[Buttons] -> FOR HERE If not cookie[Buttons Unlocked] then 404
  5 Global Buttons, Each button corresponds to a specific browser name (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.), A button is only clickable if the user's browser matches its assigned browser
  Once clicked, That button becomes globally locked (i.e., permanently activated for all users, cannot be unclicked)
  IF all 5 buttons are pressed, create cookie[File Unlocked] then globally the page just becomes WINGDING message that says to go and check the CSS for .secret
  The CSS in .secret says to remove invis html tags, which when removed reveals URL[File Console]

URL[File Console] -> FOR HERE If not cookie[File Unlocked] then 404
  A welcome message appears in a console/terminal like page that has a boot animation like old retro device
  Has the following commands: cat <>, cd <>, wget <>, ls, help, ofc you know how they work, (There is also secret command "whoami" and "sudo" which aren't in the help aka easter eggs)
  Files available:
  - / [Commands available: ls]
  - riddle.pdf [only wget, which downloads the PDF that contains the riddle]
  - riddle-hint.txt [cat -> gibberish text that only reading the caps gives the hint, which is to check the riddles EXIF, also wget to get a local file]
  - code/ [ls]
  - code/robots.txt [cat or wget, contains random shit and then a hidden password to allow access for the pdf]
  - code/LETITGROW.tree [FAILS WITH PERM DENIED NOT EVEN SUDO WORKS WITH THIS - wget or cat (doesn't actually exist)]
  The riddle when solved hints of using the Konami code in home,
  - If sudo is used “You are NOT in control... IT IS” and aborts 500 with error screen saying “Foolish user attempt to gain control”
  - If whoami is used “No matter what its still you :)” “but... wH0 @R3 ¥0u?”
  
URL[h0m3] -> FOR HERE If not cookie[Corrupt] and not cookie[corrupting] or cookie[No corruption] then redirect to URL[Home], FOR ALL If cookie[corrupting] redirect here
  A blank screen with a hidden button when clicked, create cookie[corrupting] then shows the exact replica of URL[Home] with changes:
  - LATIN AUDIO BACKGROUND SAYING RUN STOP ESCAPE
  - Every minute, static noise plays with flashes of smiley faces as well as trees, and of course text being "YOU SHOULDNT BE HERE {SESSION ID}"
  - Letters replacement of common letters to number/symbol counterparts: "o" -> "0" or "a" -> "@"
  - All text is changed to 1st person in a creepy way
  - The binary that existed is replaced with bin text saying "Last time thou hesitated, it found thine"
  - The hex that was a time is changed to the time 66:66 in HEX
  - If user reaches the bottom of the site, the site just repeats again but making it more blurry
  - After 4-5 scrolls of blurriness, a button says RESET appears, and above it in different languages for each word it says: WHY DO THIS (Japanese, Arabic etc)
  If button is clicked, remove both cookie[Corrupt] and cookie[corrupting] and creates cookie[No corruption] and redirects to URL[Home]

URL[Scroll] -> FOR HERE If not cookie[Scroll Unlocked] then 404
  console.log "So does IT like to peek behind the curtains to pull the strings, but why did you look?"

  - Files autodownload saying random characters in the name
  - Colors invert
  After 2-3 min, TTS says "You have been here for too long... Reflecting your utter stupidity of human curiosity that drives you crazy??"

  - Image one is a QR code that links to pastebin with a POEM in base64, which if translated hints on how to get KEYWORD[5] from img 2
  - Image two is a grid of black and white that actually represents binary, black is 1 and white is 2, when decoded to bin then English, it provides KEYWORD[5],
  Then if they type the KEYWORD[5] in console AND the screen size set is 666x666 they get URL[Choices] and cookie[Choice Unlocked] is made
  - the top left corner has a barely visible number [404] if typed has a 1/404 chance to redirect to URL[Moonlight] and 403/404 to 404

  Empty weird page, TTS as well as text speak/type on screen:
  - Greets user, says browser name, session ID, OS, Location as well as some of the users history
  - Then makes fun of you, opens your cam, snarky remarks, and how they don't know when to fuck off
  - It then asks a open word question, whatever is answered, once submitted it locks the answer, slowly deletes it, and types "Who Are You??" (If user alr asked this, no need to change)
  - The TTS says: "A growing sapling yet for harvest, and you my little one are but the many rotten fruits I beared, with seads of many to come" etc
  - It then talks philosophically abt trees and cycle of life and curiosity
  - Then it says "GOOD LUCK LITTLE CHILD" and CUTSCENE[Bye Cruel World] plays

  - Then flash screen with static noise and colors and clear previous text
  - "?raf os yenruoj eht gniyojne ,?huh dne eht ot esolc era uoy smees tI ,{SessionID but in reverse} iH" -> Allow Yes/No and answer correspondently
