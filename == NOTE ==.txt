extra:
- add more images, media etc. as needed (check sans fight images NECROPTOSIS - SP!Dusttale)

ALSO CHECK TAS HINTS ARE NOT TOO EASY

NOTE: Make sure all audio is IN AUDIO TAGS in jsx, and never pure tsx code
NOTE: The YouTube vid is private, do unprivate when releasing

fixme: all hardcoded audio to be in a unified variable tsx, also remove all hardcoded keywords and sensitive data and replace with env var
