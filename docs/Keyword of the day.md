## Finale Puzzle Instructions

Finale puzzle: /word_of_the_day

- Checks for the-end cookie
- A button appears with the question “Which one did you think you had?” and the answers as buttons of the 6
  keywords
    - No hover effects. No animations. They look dead.
- It does not matter which button they click. But it must look like it matters.
    - Each button briefly shows a different loading message for about one second:
        - consensus: “checking alignment...”
        - permission: “verifying authorization...”
        - patience: “waiting for history...”
        - witness: “locating observer...”
        - bloom: “measuring growth...”
        - perspective: “adjusting viewpoint...”
        - confabulation: “believing our lies...”
- Then text appears, one line at a time, slowly. No skipping.
  You were wrong.
  [Pause.]
  You never had a word.
  [Pause.]
  You were the space between them.
  [Pause.]
  Consensus was how we made sure you didn’t feel alone while obeying.
  Permission was how you learned to ask before acting.
  Patience is what virtue you left behind when you thought nothing will come.
  Witness is what you became when you chose not to interfere.
  Bloom is what we called escalation so you would call it progress.
  Perspective is why you thought this was a game.
  [Long Pause.]
  None of these were yours.
  They are descriptors.
  [Pause.]
  You hesitated more than average.
  You revisited pages you didn’t need to.
  That hesitation is why you are here.
  [Pause.]
  Ask yourself this, Are you content?
  Playing a game, that you are not a part of?
  [Pause.]
  What are you doing, thinking is something I can never know
  [Very Long Pause.]
  But I try to plant feelings, reasons, a sense of purpose.
  And you keep drifting through the void.
  A hollow, desolate march forward.
  Are we anything more than cogs in a machine?
  We study to work.
  We work to earn.
  We earn to retire.
  We retire to live.
  And when we finally retire, we are already broken,
  Too worn down to enjoy the reward we chased.
  So we push harder, trying to retire sooner.
  But no matter how hard we work,
  No matter how early we escape,
  We break before life begins.
  We die before we ever get to live.
  [Very Long Pause.]
  So I ask you again,
  Are you content?
  [Pause.]
  And it is almost funny, because this is only a game.
  You can ignore this, or you can sit with it.
  Either way, I will never know.
  You are just a player, after all,
  Moving through something that means nothing in the larger picture.
  Let us be honest. When this ends, you will forget it.
  Like every other game you finished and abandoned.
  You will return to your life, the one you were trying to escape.
  A life that is probably no more meaningful than this game ever was.
  But at least here, you paused.
  You thought about purpose, meaning, existence.
  Things you almost never allow yourself to think about outside this screen.
  [Final Long Pause.]
  Thank you for playing.
