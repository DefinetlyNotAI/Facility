All pages:
- add favicon.ico
- change all /404 to forced, while normal 404 (aka the search bar isnt 404)

Home:
- Time doesn't exist here keeps on looping??? Audio
- Make it when time hits 0 it becomes infinity sign
- Hovering over "Data" shows binary
- Add fake logs, and text and shit, like make it populated
- time to be taken from USER viewpoint, aka users time
- Hydration failed because the server-rendered timestamp (09/06/2025, 14:28:12) didn't match the client-rendered one (09/06/2025, 14:28:13), likely due to dynamic data like Date.now() being used in a component rendered during SSR.
- when No corruption -> after user presses acknowledge, redirect them to /scroll
- when corrupt -> the acknowledge button should wait for a press before redirect to h0m3
- when cookie the end always redirect to the end

h0m3:
- Copy HOME but with those changes of h0m3
- Don't replace letters/3rd person words added by h0m3, aka only replace/jumble the normal words not additional text
- actually make it scroll/loop back and keep corrupting itself...

Buttons:
- just reset the buttons, make a script (py)

file console:

- page called smileking which is only for admin (Me) and is pass protected and has message saying its not part of the puzzle, inside buttons to manually control ALL my cookies states, as well as the browsers
- sign ALL cookies pages (maybe use utils.ts to make it a function?):

// setup
import * as cookieSignature from 'cookie-signature';
const secret = process.env.COOKIE_SECRET; // keep this secret!

// Create cookie:
const signedValue = 's:' + cookieSignature.sign('myValue', secret);

// Read cookie:
const unsignedValue = cookieSignature.unsign(signedValue.slice(2), secret);
if (unsignedValue === true) // no forgery, else forged
