## About this Directory

The `docs` directory serves as an archive of thoughts, concepts, design notes, and narrative fragments created
throughout the development of this ARG, starting from its earliest conceptual stages up to DLC planning and expansion.

These documents reflect the evolution of ideas over time. Some entries may be incomplete, experimental, or no longer
fully aligned with the current canon. They are preserved intentionally, either for historical context, future reference,
or as inspiration for ongoing and future development.

Most files are complete and carry deliberate meaning within the ARG’s universe, mechanics, or narrative structure. Even
outdated material may contain clues, thematic foundations, or conceptual DNA that influenced later content.

Readers should treat this directory as a behind-the-scenes record rather than a polished or linear guide. Not everything
here is meant to be immediately understood, and not everything is guaranteed to remain canon.

## Scrapped Folder

The `docs/scrapped` folder contains ideas, concepts, and narrative elements that were considered during the development
of the ARG but ultimately set aside or discarded. These documents provide insight into the creative process and
decision-making that shaped the final product.

While these scrapped materials may not be part of the official canon, they can still offer valuable context, alternative
perspectives, or inspiration for future projects. They serve as a testament to the iterative nature of storytelling and
game design,
highlighting the evolution of ideas and the choices made along the way.

You can also find scrapped assets here (audio/ost) as well as the unused ideas.
