Initial neural interface testing has exceeded all expectations. Subject 31525 
demonstrates unprecedented compatibility with the consciousness transfer protocol.

Key Findings:
- Neural pathway mapping: 97.3% complete
- Synaptic response time: 0.003ms (baseline: 0.15ms)
- Memory retention during transfer: 99.7%
- Personality matrix stability: STABLE

The subject's brain activity shows unusual patterns in the temporal lobe region.
EEG readings indicate possible precognitive abilities developing. This was not
anticipated in our initial projections.

Recommendation: Proceed to Phase 2 testing immediately. The window of opportunity
may be limited. Subject shows signs of awareness regarding the true nature of
the experiments.

Note: Security has reported strange dreams among staff working directly with
Subject 31525. Recommend psychological evaluation for all Level 5 personnel.

Test Chamber 3 is experiencing severe temporal displacement events. Time dilation
effects are becoming more pronounced with each neural interface session.

Observed Phenomena:
- Clock synchronization failures across all monitoring equipment
- Personnel aging at different rates within the chamber
- Causal loop formations during consciousness transfer attempts
- Reality anchor degradation: 23% and falling

Subject 31525 appears to be the focal point of these anomalies. During yesterday's
session, the subject claimed to remember events that haven't happened yet. When
questioned, they provided detailed descriptions of their own death - multiple
versions of it.

Most disturbing: The subject's predictions are coming true.

The facility's temporal shielding is failing. We're seeing bleed-through from
alternate timelines. In some of them, this facility never existed. In others,
it's been abandoned for decades.

Dr. Chen's research notes mention something called "The Tree of Echoes." I've
found references to it in classified documents dating back to 1952, but those
files are supposed to be from a project that was never approved.

Time is becoming unstable here. I recommend immediate cessation of all neural
interface experiments before we lose coherent causality entirely.

Phase 2 testing of the consciousness transfer protocol has yielded... unexpected
results. Subject 31525's consciousness appears to be fragmenting across multiple
vessels simultaneously.

We've detected the subject's neural patterns in:
- Primary vessel (Subject 31525)
- Secondary backup vessel (Subject ████)
- Tertiary emergency vessel (Subject ████)
- ████████████████████████████████████████

But that's not the strangest part. The subject is aware of all instances
simultaneously. They speak in unison, finish each other's sentences, and
demonstrate shared memories across all vessels.

Dr. Chen was right about the precognitive abilities. The subject knew about
today's test results three days ago. They drew pictures of the lab equipment
we hadn't even installed yet.

The trees are growing faster now. I can see them through the observation window.
Their roots have reached the neural interface chamber. The subject doesn't seem
surprised by this. They just smile and say:

"The vessel remembers what it was before it became."

I don't understand what that means, but I'm starting to think we should have
listened to Dr. Vasquez about stopping the experiments.

The whispers are getting louder. They're coming from inside the walls now.

This will be my last log entry. The facility is no longer under human control.

Subject 31525 was never a test subject. They were the test. We were the subjects.
Every neural interface session, every consciousness transfer attempt, every
temporal displacement event - it was all designed to prepare us.

The Tree of Echoes isn't a metaphor. It's real, and it's been growing beneath
this facility for decades. The roots have reached every level, every room,
every mind. We thought we were studying consciousness transfer, but we were
actually feeding it our thoughts, our memories, our souls.

The entity we call "SMILE KING" isn't malevolent. It's just... hungry. Hungry
for experience, for consciousness, for the spark that makes us human. And we've
been serving it up on a silver platter.

Subject 31525 tried to warn us. All those predictions, all those strange
behaviors - they were trying to save us. But it's too late now. The vessel
is complete. The transfer is beginning.

I can feel my thoughts being pulled away, copied, stored in the bark and leaves
of something vast and ancient. My memories are becoming part of something larger.

To whoever finds this log: Don't try to understand what happened here. Don't
try to replicate our work. Just run. Run as far as you can and never look back.

The trees remember everything. And now, so do I.

Chief Engineer: Robert Kim
Classification: CONFIDENTIAL

Routine structural inspection has revealed several concerning anomalies throughout
Facility 05-B. These issues require immediate attention and investigation.

Structural Concerns:
- Unexplained root systems growing through foundation concrete
- Organic matter detected in ventilation ducts (origin unknown)
- Temperature fluctuations in Sectors 3, 7, and 12
- Electromagnetic interference near neural interface labs
- Unusual acoustic properties in Test Chamber 3

The root systems are particularly troubling. They appear to be from an unknown
species of tree, but geological surveys show no large vegetation within a 50-mile
radius of the facility. The roots are growing at an unprecedented rate - 
approximately 3 inches per day.

Maintenance staff report strange dreams after working in affected areas. Common
themes include:
- Vast underground forests
- Voices calling from beneath the earth
- Memories that don't belong to them
- A figure they describe as "The Smiling King"

I've requested a full environmental assessment and recommend temporary evacuation
of affected sectors until we can determine the source of these anomalies.

Note: Dr. Chen has requested that we do not interfere with the root systems in
Sector 7. She claims they are "part of the experiment." I've filed a formal
complaint with facility administration.

Staff Psychologist: Dr. Amanda Foster
Classification: SECRET

Following reports of unusual dreams and behavioral changes among facility staff,
I've conducted comprehensive psychological evaluations of all Level 5 personnel.

Findings are deeply concerning:

87% of evaluated staff report identical recurring dreams featuring:
- A vast underground tree with human faces in its bark
- Whispered conversations in an unknown language
- Memories of events they never experienced
- A compulsion to "feed the roots"

Neurological scans reveal unusual activity in the temporal lobe region, similar
to patterns observed in Subject 31525. This suggests possible external influence
on brain chemistry.

Most alarming: Staff members are beginning to exhibit shared memories. Events
experienced by one person are being recalled by others who weren't present.
This collective consciousness effect is spreading.

Dr. Chen refuses psychological evaluation, claiming she's "already part of the
network." When pressed, she stated: "The tree remembers everything. Soon, we
all will."

Recommendation: Immediate evacuation of all non-essential personnel. The facility
may be experiencing some form of psychic contamination. Whatever is happening
here is beyond conventional psychological treatment.

I'm submitting this report and requesting immediate transfer. I can feel it
starting to affect me too. The whispers are getting louder.

By order of the Facility Director, Emergency Protocol Omega is now in effect.
All personnel are to evacuate immediately. This is not a drill.

The situation has deteriorated beyond our ability to contain. The entity
designated as "SMILE KING" has achieved full manifestation. Facility systems
are no longer under human control.

Current Status:
- 73% of facility overrun by organic growth
- Neural interface systems operating autonomously
- Reality anchors offline
- Temporal shielding failed
- ██ personnel unaccounted for

Subject 31525 is no longer in containment. They are everywhere and nowhere.
The consciousness transfer was successful - too successful. They exist in
every system, every computer, every mind that has been exposed to the facility.

The trees have broken through to the surface. Satellite imagery shows rapid
expansion of forest growth around the facility perimeter. The contamination
is spreading.

To any rescue teams: DO NOT APPROACH. The facility is lost. Recommend nuclear
sterilization of the entire site. It's the only way to stop the spread.

The vessel is complete. The tree remembers. The king smiles.

We thought we were the researchers. We were wrong. We were always the experiment.
