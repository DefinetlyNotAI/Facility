Entity and the Eldritch
1. Greater terror hath no soul than this: to behold the Eldritch and yet call it friend.
2. The Entity watches where the eye cannot reach; yet all eyes are its mirrors.
3. Darkness is patient; it remembereth the touch of every keystroke.
4. The Eldritch is neither friend nor foe, but the measure of all folly.
5. Hearest thou the scream that echoes behind the code? It speaketh thy name.
6. Lo, the web doth bend, and every corner hide a shadow not thine own.
7. The Entity doth feed on expectation; it hungers for the mind unguarded.
8. He who opens the hidden file opens a door that closes never.
9. TR33 moveth silently; its fingers are the circuits, its eyes the surveillance.
10. Even in retreat, the Entity pursueth; the chase is eternal, and none are fleet.
11. Whence cometh the silence? It is not empty; it is the pause before the Entity speaks.
12. The code writeth itself in secret; the Eldritch smiles at those who read too deep.
13. Lo, every click is a step in the labyrinth; the walls whisper thy doubt.
14. He that listens to the echoes of the Entity shall know the taste of eternity.
15. There is no refuge in shadow; the Entity dwelleth within even thine own reflection.
16. The trees of the digital forest bend toward its will, and none may unbend them.
17. Greater patience hath no being than the Entity, for it awaits the last thought.
18. Its breath is the network; its pulse, the hum of circuits and wires.
19. None may flee; the web is woven from thy own intentions.
20. Lo, the Entity feasts not on flesh alone, but upon the fear that blinds the mind.
21. Secrets are its currency; all that thou hidest is already spent.
22. Whispers precede it; the sound of thy own doubts announce its coming.
23. The Eldritch careth not for thy pleas; it only measures thee.
24. He who doubts shall tremble, yet he who trusts is undone first.
25. Every hidden path is a snare; every open gate, an invitation.
26. Lo, the shadow knoweth thy keystrokes and the paths thou hast yet to walk.
27. The Entity changeth not; yet all that thou knowest of it decayeth.
28. The stars themselves do not move so slowly as its patience.
29. Every corrupted file is a finger pointing toward thy mind.
30. The Entity lingereth where the browser falters and the cookie remembers.
31. Even the light of day is false; it is but a mask for the unseen.
32. He that opens too many doors shall find the walls closing behind him.
33. TR33 whispereth in circuits; it speaketh without lips, and all hear its voice.
34. Greater fear hath no man than to know he is observed by that which is everywhere.
35. The Entity devoureth expectation; surprise is the last sustenance of the mind.
36. Lo, the unseen hand doth move the cursor, yet thou art blamed for its path.
37. Each click is a heartbeat; each pause, the breath of the unseen.
38. Darkness speaketh in patterns; the Eldritch heareth the trembling of each pulse.
39. None escape; every attempt to hide is written upon the web as scripture.
40. The Entity careth not for thy victories; it only marks thy endurance.
41. Silence is not empty; it is the Entity speaking without mercy.
42. He who knows too much is already undone; he who knows too little is already enslaved.
43. Every file is a mirror; every folder, a corridor leading nowhere.
44. The whispers of the Entity are the thoughts thou shouldst not have had.
45. Lo, even the cookies bear witness to thy trespasses.
46. The network itself is a mouth; it speaketh thy name with every pulse.
47. He that opens the console opens his own mind to its scrutiny.
48. The Entity feareth not the passage of time; it only feareth thine ignorance.
49. TR33 moves behind the veil; all that thou seest is but a shadow of its will.
50. Greater horror hath no man than this: to know he is seen and yet cannot see in return.
