## Finale Puzzle Instructions

Finale puzzle: /word_of_the_day

- Requires submitting all the 7 words (also checks for the-end cookie)
    - When the last word is submitted, do not show success text,
      Instead, the page pauses longer than usual. Long enough that the player thinks it froze.
- Once done, a button appears with the question “Which one did you think you had?” and the answers as buttons of the 6
  keywords
    - No hover effects. No animations. They look dead.
- It does not matter which button they click. But it must look like it matters.
    - Each button briefly shows a different loading message for about one second:
        - consensus: “checking alignment...”
        - permission: “verifying authorization...”
        - patience: “waiting for history...”
        - witness: “locating observer...”
        - bloom: “measuring growth...”
        - perspective: “adjusting viewpoint...”
        - confabulation: “believing our lies...”
- Then text appears, one line at a time, slowly. No skipping.
  You were wrong.
  [Pause.]
  You never had a word.
  [Pause.]
  You were the space between them.
  [Pause.]
  Consensus was how we made sure you didn’t feel alone while obeying.
  Permission was how you learned to ask before acting.
  Patience is what virtue you left behind when you thought nothing will come.
  Witness is what you became when you chose not to interfere.
  Bloom is what we called escalation so you would call it progress.
  Perspective is why you thought this was a game.
  [Long Pause.]
  None of these were yours.
  They are descriptors.
  [Pause.]
  You hesitated more than average.
  You revisited pages you didn’t need to.
  That hesitation is why you are here.
  [Pause.]
  Ask yourself this, Are you content?
  Playing a game, that you are not a part of?
  [Pause.]
  What are you doing, thinking is something I can never know
  [Very Long Pause.]
  But, I try seed in feelings, reasons, and purpose.
  Though you just chug along the void.
  An empty desolate purpose,
  All we are but cogs to a machine
  We study to work, We work to earn, We earn to retire, We retire to live...
  But once we retire, we are broken, cannot enjoy the fruits of our labor
  So we work harder, to retire sooner, but no matter how hard we work, no matter how soon we retire
  We are always broken before we can enjoy life,
  We DIE before we can LIVE.
  [Very Long Pause.]
  So I ask you again,
  Are you content?
  [Pause.]
  And It's funny, because this is just a game
  You may ignore this, or you may think about it
  And either way, I will never know
  Because you are just a player in a game,
  Which is completely meaningless in the grand scheme of things.
  Because let's be serious, once this ends, you will forget about this
  Just like all the other games you have played before
  And you will go back to your life, the life you were trying to escape from
  The life that is probably just as meaningless as this game
  But hey, at least in this game, you got to think about purpose, meaning, and existence
  Something you probably never do in your real life
  [Final Long Pause.]
  Thank you for playing.
