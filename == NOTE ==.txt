All pages:
- add favicon.ico
- change all /404 to forced, while normal 404 (aka the search bar isnt 404)

Home:
- Time doesn't exist here keeps on looping??? Audio
- Make it when time hits 0 it becomes infinity sign
- Hovering over "Data" shows binary
- Add fake logs, and text and shit, like make it populated
- time to be taken from USER viewpoint, aka users time
- Hydration failed because the server-rendered timestamp (09/06/2025, 14:28:12) didn't match the client-rendered one (09/06/2025, 14:28:13), likely due to dynamic data like Date.now() being used in a component rendered during SSR.
- when No corruption -> after user presses acknowledge, redirect them to /scroll
- when corrupt -> the acknowledge button should wait for a press before redirect to h0m3
- when cookie the end always redirect to the end

h0m3:
- Copy HOME but with those changes of h0m3
- Don't replace letters/3rd person words added by h0m3, aka only replace/jumble the normal words not additional text
- actually make it scroll/loop back and keep corrupting itself...

Buttons:
- just reset the buttons, make a script (py)

file console:
- add clear command,
- implement wget to actually download said file,
- sudo should be a jumpscare on the user,

- add images, media etc. as needed (check sans fight images NECROPTOSIS - SP!Dusttale)
- add cheat detection and a callout for that
- sign ALL cookies pages (maybe use utils.ts to make it a function?) and make them expire after a long time:

// setup
import * as cookieSignature from 'cookie-signature';
const secret = process.env.COOKIE_SECRET; // keep this secret!

// Create cookie:
const signedValue = 's:' + cookieSignature.sign('myValue', secret);

// Read cookie:
const unsignedValue = cookieSignature.unsign(signedValue.slice(2), secret);
if (unsignedValue === true) // no forgery, else forged
