// NOTE: Check window size, maybe it is the issue
  - Implement run feature correctly
  - Implement the shutdown, tho the restart will refresh, and shutdown will make 1 error saying "Can't find shutdown protocol - Please restart TREE98 - There is NO ESCAPE"

- Retype the file text
- Add some files to system32
- Rename Windows to Tree98
- Implement windows full screen, resize and minimize feature correctly
  - also all windows should not allow resize that hides some of its elements
- Start menu should not have the "Programs" section as its the same as "Documents"
- Implement settings app features
- Add the CMD app
- Any app that opens must appear on the taskbar, if clicked it should bring the app to the front
- Implement or Test the VESSEL_BOOT.exe actually crashing etc as per the puzzle, note tho an error first pops always saying "This is not the REAL you? I cannot connect yet, YOU don't have HIS permission.. or maybe YOUR own permission... Wait until the time is right."
  - Runs the EXE in fullscreen, disables the mouse, and plays the terminal text dramatically.
    - User input awaited (only accept no, any other input will be deleted and retyped as no manually/hard)
  - When crashing -> Error popups start stacking
                     System audio/visual glitches or loops
                     Apps start auto-opening and crashing
                     Cursor and visuals begin desynchronizing
                     Files disappear or 404 on open
  - These escalate until the system crashes into a blue-error-like crash screen.
  - After the crash, redirect the user to /file-console.
- finally add audio and sfx for everything, including sfx of old mouse clicks etc


Maybe later create a group of mermaid file of all app routes to visualize the app structure and flow.
