- split everything to data.ts
- Retype the file text
- Add some files to system32
- finally add audio and sfx for everything, including sfx of old mouse clicks etc
- file console redirect to tree98 if tree cutscene cookie doesnt exist

Maybe later create a group of mermaid file of all app routes to visualize the app structure and flow.
