All pages:
- ⚠ Unsupported metadata themeColor is configured in metadata export in /home. Please move it to viewport export instead.
      Read more: https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-viewport
- if user didnt accept terms, always redirect to terms page
- if corrupting then SHOULDNT ALLOW ANY OTHER PAGE TO WORK -> ALL Redirect to h0m3

Home:
- Time doesnt exist here keeps on looping??? Audio
- Make it when time hits 0 it becomes infinity sign
- Hovering over "Data" shows binary
- Add fake logs, and text and shit, like make it populated
- time to be taken from USER viewpoint, aka users time
- Hydration failed because the server-rendered timestamp (09/06/2025, 14:28:12) didn't match the client-rendered one (09/06/2025, 14:28:13), likely due to dynamic data like Date.now() being used in a component rendered during SSR.
- when No corruption -> after user presses acknowledge, redirect them to /scroll
- when corrupt -> the acknowledge button should wait for a press before redirect to h0m3
- when cookie the end always redirect to the end

h0m3:
- Copy HOME but with those changes of h0m3
- Dont replace letters/3rd person words added by h0me, aka only replace/jumble the normal words not additional text
- actually make it scroll/loop back and keep corrupting itself...
