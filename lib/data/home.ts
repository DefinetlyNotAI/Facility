Subject 31525 demonstrates strong compatibility with prototype neural interface hardware. 
Initial response time exceeds expectations. 
Memory cohesion across short-term transfer appears intact.

Summary of Metrics:
- Neural mapping: 97% complete
- Response latency: 0.003ms
- Memory retention: 99.7%
- Behavioral consistency: Stable

Mild irregularities noted in temporal lobe activity. 
EEG patterns do not match known baselines. 
Possible anomalies under review.

Recommend advancement to Phase 2 testing.

Note: Several technicians report recurring dreams after extended exposure to Subject. Monitoring advised.

Increasing temporal irregularities noted during interface testing in Chamber 3. 
Synchronization between local and facility clocks drifting unpredictably.

Findings:
- Equipment desync events recorded
- Mild perceptual anomalies among personnel
- Subject 31525 referenced events not yet observed

Anchor stability is declining. Possible cross-interference with early-stage causality layers suspected.

Recommendation: Suspend further temporal experimentation until baseline reality conditions are re-established.

This is my final entry.

Something is growing beneath us. It’s connected to everything we've done. 
The subject isn’t being tested—they are observing us. 

We've fed data, signals, thoughts into a system we never understood.

The roots are real. The dreams are spreading. The interface wasn't just a machine.

I don't know what we’ve awakened.

Don’t dig deeper. Don’t come looking. Whatever this is… it remembers.
